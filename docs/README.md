# DependencyTree

Work with an object graph of things that depend on other things.

Get a list in order of things which must be present before other things.

This is pluggable. I am working with PS modules and classes, but you are not limited to these.

I have created this project because the above two projects, while serving their purpose well, do not allow for working with dependencies outside their problem space. I wanted something general-purpose.
